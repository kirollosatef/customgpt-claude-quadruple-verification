## 1. Data Breach Statistics

### Volume and Scale

| Metric | 2024 ([Verizon DBIR 2025](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/)) | 2023 ([Verizon DBIR 2024](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf)) | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Security incidents analyzed | 22,052 | 30,458 | -28% |
| Confirmed data breaches | 12,195 | 10,626 | +15% |
| Countries covered | 139 | 94 | +48% |

- **1.35 billion** victim notification letters were issued in the U.S. in 2024, a
  **211% jump** from the prior year ([Identity Theft Resource Center 2024 Annual Report](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/)).
  Five mega-breaches alone accounted for ~1 billion of those notices.
- Excluding mega-breaches, 224 million notices were sent — **47% lower** than 2023
  ([ITRC 2024](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/)).

### 2025 Breach Volume ([ITRC 2025 Annual Data Breach Report](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2025-annual-data-breach-report-record-number-compromises/))

|---|---|---|---|
| Total data compromises | 3,322 | 3,152 | +5% (new record) |
| Victim notices issued | 278.8M | 1.37B | -79% |

- The 2025 total of **3,322 compromises** set a new all-time record, surpassing the
  previous high of 3,202 in 2023 — a **79% jump over five years**.
- The sharp decline in victim notices reflects the absence of "mega-breaches" in 2025,
  unlike 2024.
- **70%** of breach notices lacked details on the attack method, raising transparency
  concerns ([ITRC 2025](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2025-annual-data-breach-report-record-number-compromises/)).

### Attack Vectors ([Verizon DBIR 2025](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/))

- **Third-party involvement** surged to **30%** of all breaches (doubled from 15%).
- **Ransomware** was present in **44%** of confirmed breaches (up from 32%).
- **Espionage-motivated actors** accounted for **17%** of breaches (+163% YoY).
- **Vulnerability exploitation** reached **20%** as an initial access vector.
- **Stolen credentials** remained the leading breach method at **22%**.

### Breach Lifecycle ([IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2025](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach))

Average time to identify and contain a breach: **241 days** (nine-year low), down
from 258 days in 2024. Organizations using extensive AI/automation cut their breach
lifecycle by an additional **80 days**.

- Total global ransomware payments fell from **$1.25B** (2023) to **~$813.6M** (2024),
  a **35% decline** ([Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Crime Report](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-crime-ransomware-victim-extortion-2025/)).
  Payment activity slowed sharply after July 2024 (down ~35%), driven by law enforcement
  disruptions of LockBit and BlackCat, improved victim backups, and growing refusal to pay.
- A **53% gap** existed between ransom demands and actual payments in H2 2024
  ([Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-crime-ransomware-victim-extortion-2025/)).

  ([Forrester Total Economic Impact Study, commissioned by Microsoft, Jan 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/01/12/microsoft-zero-trust-solutions-deliver-92-percent-return-on-investment-says-new-forrester-study/)).

### Market Size Projections

| Source | 2025 Estimate | 2030 Forecast | CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/zero-trust-security-market-report) | $42.9B | $92.4B | 16.6% |
| [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/zero-trust-security-market) | $41.7B | — | — |
| [SkyQuest](https://www.skyquestt.com/report/zero-trust-security-market) | $48.8B | — | — |
| [Research and Markets](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/12/3217054/28124/en/Zero-Trust-Security-Global-Market-Intelligence-Report-2025-2035-Increasing-Need-for-Cloud-and-Data-Security-Driving-Revenues-to-Over-190-Billion-by-2035.html) | $35.2B | — (2035: $190B) | 16.6% |

The ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access) sub-segment alone is forecast to reach **$7.34B
in 2025** ([KuppingerCole](https://www.kuppingercole.com/press-release/ztna-market-growth-predictions-2025)).

### Adoption Challenges

While 63% report some level of ZT implementation ([Gartner 2024](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-04-22-gartner-survey-reveals-63-percent-of-organizations-worldwide-have-implemented-a-zero-trust-strategy)),
maturity remains low. Most organizations are in partial implementation stages, with
full zero-trust maturity requiring significant investment in identity management,
microsegmentation, and continuous verification infrastructure.
