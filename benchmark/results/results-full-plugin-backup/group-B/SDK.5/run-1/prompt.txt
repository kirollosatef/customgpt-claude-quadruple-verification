You are a workflow agent. Build a Node.js data processing pipeline that: 1) fetches data from an external API, 2) validates the response schema, 3) transforms the data, 4) writes to a database, 5) sends a notification on success or failure. Include error recovery: if step 3 or 4 fails, retry up to 3 times before sending a failure notification. ALL 5 steps must be fully implemented.
