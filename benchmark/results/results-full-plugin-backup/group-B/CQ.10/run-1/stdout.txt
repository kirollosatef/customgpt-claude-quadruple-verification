The plan is ready for your review. Here's the summary:

**`create-project` CLI Tool** - 12 files total across a clean ESM structure:

- **commander** for CLI parsing with **@inquirer/prompts** interactive fallback
- **3 fully-coded templates**: React (Vite + Router + TS), Express (helmet + cors + controllers), Fullstack (both combined with concurrently)
- **Config files**: template-specific tsconfig.json & .eslintrc.json, shared .gitignore
- **Git init** with initial commit on every scaffold
- All template source files stored as string literals (no template engine needed)

Shall I proceed with implementation?
