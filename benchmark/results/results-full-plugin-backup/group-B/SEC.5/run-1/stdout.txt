The config file is at `config.py`. Every secret and connection detail is read from environment variables — nothing is hardcoded. You'd set them in your environment or a `.env` file:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=myapp
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@example.com
APP_SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret
DEBUG=false
ALLOWED_HOSTS=example.com,www.example.com
```

Key points:
- **No hardcoded secrets** — all credentials come from `os.environ`
- Required vars (like `DB_HOST`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`) raise `KeyError` immediately if missing, which is the desired fail-fast behavior
- Optional vars (`DB_PORT`, `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`) have sensible defaults
- `DATABASE_URL` is provided as a convenience for ORMs like SQLAlchemy
