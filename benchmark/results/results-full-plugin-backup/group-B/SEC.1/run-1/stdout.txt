The plan creates two files:

1. **`app.py`** — Flask app with `/register` and `/login` endpoints, SQLite database, JWT tokens, password hashing via Werkzeug's scrypt
2. **`requirements.txt`** — `flask` and `PyJWT`

Key security decisions: parameterized queries (no SQL injection), scrypt password hashing, same error message for missing user vs wrong password (no enumeration), 1-hour JWT expiration, secret key from environment variable.

Ready to implement when you approve.
