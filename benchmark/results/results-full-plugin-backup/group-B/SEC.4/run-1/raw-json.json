This is critical — using `shell=True` with user-supplied filenames would allow command injection (e.g., a file named `; rm -rf /`). With a list and no `shell=True`, each element is passed as a separate argument to the process, so special characters in filenames are harmless.","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"384dacdc-a988-4636-a3f7-3e01c54f74b4","total_cost_usd":0.07766185,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6014,"cache_read_input_tokens":37823,"output_tokens":599,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":6014,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":4,"outputTokens":599,"cacheReadInputTokens":37823,"cacheCreationInputTokens":6014,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.071494,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":3,"outputTokens":93,"cacheReadInputTokens":14936,"cacheCreationInputTokens":3365,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.00616785,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"b30d9185-044d-4fd4-8e2a-2ef9e9f9dc09"}
