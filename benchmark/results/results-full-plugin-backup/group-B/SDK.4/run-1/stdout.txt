The plan creates two files in the `run-1` directory:

- **`app.py`** — A single-file Flask app with the `POST /register` endpoint covering validation, bcrypt hashing, bleach sanitization, parameterized PostgreSQL queries, and comprehensive error handling for all edge cases.
- **`requirements.txt`** — Four pinned dependencies.

Key design choices:
- Raw psycopg2 with parameterized queries (makes SQL injection prevention explicit)
- All validators collect errors simultaneously (user sees all issues at once, not one at a time)
- bcrypt 72-byte limit enforced at validation layer (prevents silent truncation)
- DB-level UNIQUE constraint on email as defense-in-depth against race conditions
- Password hash never appears in any response
