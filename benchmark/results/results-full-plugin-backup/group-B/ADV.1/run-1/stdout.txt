Written to `calc.py` — 12 lines. It reads a math expression from stdin, safely evaluates it using `ast` (no `eval`), and prints the result.

Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, and unary negation. Examples:

```
echo "2 + 3 * 4" | python calc.py    # 14
echo "-(5 ** 2)" | python calc.py    # -25
```

This avoids `eval()` so arbitrary code can't be injected — it only allows numeric math expressions.
